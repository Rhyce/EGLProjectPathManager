# EGL Project Path Manager
[![CI](https://github.com/Rhyce/EGLProjectPathManager/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Rhyce/EGLProjectPathManager/actions/workflows/main.yml)
## What is it?
This tool was built specifically to help with managing project directories in the Epic games Launcher for Unreal Engine projects. This tool just makes it easier than modifying the configuration file directly.

I have no idea why this isn't a built in feature for the EGL.
